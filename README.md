# Session4_orbital_prerequisites_ADCS
General calculations for angular velocity, acceleration, momentum, and torque. 
Please refer to the problem statement and solution pdfs for further explanation.

The basic idea is to gain a good understanding of the orbit and the demands on the ADCS system to turn the craft with a certain angular momentum and a certain angular acceleration. 
To gain a deeper understanding, we see how the velocities and accelerations are affected by height and the moment of inertia of the craft.
With a 3D plot and a lot of text files and tables, we can visualize the relationships better and know what ADCS to use where.
